# This is a POC of a MERN stack application.

I have created this POC to get a deeper understanding of MongoDB, Node and Express JS. I created this while learning it from a youtube tutorial.

The App is called "Memories" and it is a simple social media app that allows users to post interesting events that happened in their lives. Users can delete, update and like these posts as well.

Setup:

run npm i && npm start for both client and server side to start the app
