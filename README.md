# This is a POC of a MERN stack application.

I have created this POC to get a deeper understanding of two areas:
1.  MongoDB, Node and Express JS. 
2. Authentication

The App is called "Memories" and it is a simple social media app that allows users to post events. Users can delete, update and like these posts as well. I have implemented both Google and JWT authentication.
Delete, update and like priviledges are customized according to the logged in user.

I created this while learning it from a youtube tutorial.
